 <h1>Prerequisites</
Before starting this journey, I ensured I had:

• An AWS EC2 instance running Ubuntu
• Basic knowledge of Linux commands
• A Python Project ready for deployment

>>Personal Note: Setting up the EC2 instance was straightforward, but I recommend thoroughly understanding AWS security groups and network settings before proceeding.
Ensure that ports 5000 or 8501 are open in the security group.
